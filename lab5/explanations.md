1. **object_socket.py**:
   - This file contains two classes, `ObjectSenderSocket` and `ObjectReceiverSocket`, responsible for sending and receiving Python objects respectively.
   - `ObjectSenderSocket`:
     - Initializes a TCP socket and binds it to a specified IP address and port.
     - Waits for a receiver to connect by listening for incoming connections.
     - Once a connection is established, it sends Python objects serialized using the `pickle` module over the socket.
   - `ObjectReceiverSocket`:
     - Connects to a sender by creating a TCP socket and connecting to the specified IP address and port.
     - Receives serialized Python objects from the sender and deserializes them using `pickle`.
   - Both classes provide methods for checking connection status, closing the socket connection, sending and receiving objects, and handling timeouts.

2. **example_producer.py**:
   - Imports `cv2` for video processing and `numpy` for array manipulation.
   - Creates an instance of `ObjectSenderSocket` to establish a connection with a receiver.
   - Opens a video file using OpenCV (`cv2.VideoCapture`) and enters a loop to read frames from the video.
   - Sends each frame along with a flag indicating whether the frame was successfully read (`ret`) to the receiver using the `send_object` method of `ObjectSenderSocket`.
   - Breaks out of the loop when no more frames are available or when the user presses the 'q' key.
   - Releases the video capture object.

3. **example_consumer.py**:
   - Imports `cv2` for video processing.
   - Creates an instance of `ObjectReceiverSocket` to connect to the sender.
   - Enters a loop to receive objects from the sender using the `recv_object` method of `ObjectReceiverSocket`.
   - Each received object is a tuple containing a flag (`ret`) indicating whether a frame was successfully received and the frame itself.
   - Displays each received frame using OpenCV's `imshow` function.
   - Breaks out of the loop when no more frames are received or when the user presses the 'q' key.
   - Destroys any active OpenCV windows.

soooo the producer (`example_producer.py`) reads frames from a video file, sends them over the network using a sender socket, while the consumer (`example_consumer.py`) receives these frames and displays them in real-time using OpenCV. The object socket classes (`ObjectSenderSocket` and `ObjectReceiverSocket`) handle the networking aspects, enabling communication between the producer and consumer processes.
